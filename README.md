PERCIVILLE 4DIGIT BruteForce in order of most used pins
I compiled a list of the most used 4 digit pins - by most used, i mean all 10,000 combos of the 4 digit pin's but in order of most used.
I have then added a STRING before the pin
Followed by an enter and a wait 5000 for 5 second delay 
Bad USB & Rubber ducky script.

Dic Merger
is for combining multiple dictionaries.
Specifically all the dic's created by iCopy device and combining them all into on big hefty file and removing duplicate entries.

those are the main files, all others are just scripts from over the years I have made and just found usefull.
